# my-first-repo

Welcome! [Code institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This is my first ever project, I have created a basic html and css website that links to a discription of what html and css are.

## Technologies used.
HTML, CSS, Github, Gitpod, and Git Pages.

## Terminal commands
- Use python3 -m http.server to create a live preview of your code.
- Use git add too add files to your repostiory.
- Use git commit -m "message here" to commit to github.
- Use git push to push code to github.
- Use git rm to remove files.
- Use git status to see current status of your files.

Hopefully this small project helps whoever finds it!
